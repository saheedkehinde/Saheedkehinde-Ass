# Student Data Manipulation Program

This project is a Javascript program that performs data manipulation on an array of student objects. It calculates average grades, finds the top-performing student, and sorts students by their average grades.

## Problem Statement

The program processes a dataset of students, where each student has an `id`, `name`, and an array of `grades`. The main tasks are:
1.  Calculate Average Grades**: Compute the average grade for each student.
2.  Find Top Student**: Identify the student with the highest average grade.
3.  Sort Students by Average Grade**: List students in descending order based on their average grade.

## How to Run the Program

This program is written in Javascript and can be run using Node.js.

### Prerequisites

- You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/ ) installed on your machine.

## Steps to Execute

1.  **Clone the repository or download the files.**
    - Make sure you have `cashier.js` in your project folder.

2.  **Open your terminal or command prompt.**

3.  **Navigate to the project directory where `cashier.js` is located.**
    
    cd path/to/your/project
    

4.  **Run the script using the following command:**
    
    node cashier.js
    

5.  **View the output.**
    - The program will print the results of the three tasks to the console, showing the calculated averages, the top student, and the sorted list of students.
